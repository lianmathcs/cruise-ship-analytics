# 🛳️ Cruise Ship Analytics

This project analyzes and visualizes real-world data of over 1,500 cruise ships from around the world. 
It includes feature engineering, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, Jupyter Notebook, 
and popular data science libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
